Overview
========

DroneDesign is a project I decided to undertake when i had to design a fixed-wing drone and i realised that there were not so many tools out there, and very few of them are free or open-source. As I made my designs, I worked on this app, and I hope to further develop it much further in the coming months.

A very simple tool, it is meant to assist in the initial (or conceptual) design stage of a fixed-wing drone, giving a very basic idea of how to size the wing, prop, motor (coming soon) and few more functionality.
