# To-Do

## propeller side of app

- replace unnecessary ifs with signals and slots
- combine setMinimum and setMaximum into setRange
- use events to automatically set text of lineEdit once slider is set programmatically
- use events to automatically set self.value once slider is moved programmatically
- use events to know when a radiobutton was clicked but the choice wasnt changed
- only call legend when the plot is reinitialized like with the radiobuttons
- shade the area where the efficiency falls within a useful range of values and get the rpm or j for that range
- this class should also automatically handle the legends
- error handling loop to prevent crashing, and catching variables to use for error assessment
- paint the inside of searchbutton black to look like the pyplot toolbuttons

## main app

- build exe and installer
- break up UI into multiple pages
- save dataframes and other data
